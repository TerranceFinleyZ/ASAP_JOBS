# ASAP_JOBS

ASAP JOBS is a third-party online referral and job-training agency that helps high-performing job seekers land a career in today's extremely competitive market. We leverage our vast network and in-person connections to acquire new and better jobs for our clients.

What We Do
We help job seekers by utilizing references and referrals to give them a significant advantage. Instead of being just another application in a pile of résumés, our clients get direct access to hiring managers and employees.

How It Works
Initial Contact: Clients find us through various access points. When they're ready to get started, they schedule a meeting with one of our ASAP Talent Agents.

Career Consultation: The Talent Agent meets with the client to understand their needs and determine the best career path.

Referral & Placement: The Talent Agent will then either submit a referral to a company in our established network or reach out to hiring managers and employees on platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram. This ensures the client's application gets priority and stands out from the rest.

In just the first three days, we have already accumulated 10 clients solely from a single Facebook post, without using LinkedIn or Indeed yet.
