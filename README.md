# ASAP_JOBS

ASAP JOBS was built with Vite.js, TypeScript, Icons, Framer-motion, Tailwind CSS, Gemini and GSAP.
I used Canva for design, video editing, QRcodes and 3D assets. I also used ElevenLabs for AI voice.
I use HubSpot CRM for scheduling, Google Sheets, and AI chat flow for client service.
I use Indeed, LinkedIn, Zoom and Venmo for marketing, Meetings and payments.
Hosting: Netlify.

What is ASAPJOBS:

ASAPJOBS is a third-party online referral and job-training agency that leverages references and referrals to assist high-performing job seekers in this extremely competitive job market to help land a career.
Using our vast network tools like LinkedIn and in-person connections, we can leverage our skills to acquire new and better job.

How does it work:

Clients will enter the website through our many access points. When ready to get started, the client will fill out the best time for a meeting with an ASAP Talent Agent.
The Talent Agent will have a meeting with the client to verify their needs and determine what career path would be right for the job seeker.
The Talent Agent will either send in a referral for the client to an already established company, or the Talent Agent will navigate LinkedIn, Facebook, TikTok, or Instagram to make contact with a hiring manager or employees to give the client a referral and put the client on the top of the résumé list.

Early achivmets:

Third day since the agency was posted, and we've already accumulated 10 clients/job seekers.
Not using LinkedIn or Indeed (yet) just a single facebook post.
